This code:

* Gets a list of candidates from Wikipedia and outputs
    candidates_from_wikipedia.json (wikipedia.py)
* Gets a list of candidates from YourNextMP and outputs
    candidates_from_ynmp.json (ynmp.py)

* Generates a static HTML file giving a diff between the two sources
    (generate_output_html.py)

These steps happen by running scrape_again.sh

It also has a database (actually a csv file) for mapping different spellings
of the same person or constituency to a single, canonical name.
merge.py shows how it can work for constituency names: there's no "human"
interface for this yet.


Drawbacks:

It's not thread-safe.

We should use a proper database, not dump to json files. Then we could have
mappings be editable, and generate_output_html.py can become a lot more
dynamic.
